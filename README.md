## Project Aegis: Quest-based on-chain marketing automation tool 

Web3 projects often use quests and bounties to attract new users to try out their products. But much less efforts are spent on retaining them.

Enter Project Aegis. It allows project teams to reach out to users who have completed a quest based on custom conditions (after getting users' consent).

For example, a follow-on quest can be passed along one week after the first is done, or a link to community leaderboard can be sent at the end of every month. This incentivizes user loyalty and creates sustained engagement.

Built at ETHOnline 2022 using Solidity (deployed on Polygon Mumbai), XMTP Protocol, Go and Next.js.
